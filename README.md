This repository contains my personal notes about commands I use regularly.
At the moment they are not formatted and are missing annotations.
I am sharing publicly because I am sure there are others like me who would need these handy.

I do not claim any of these notes as my own knowledge; rather, it is a collection of commands and sequences that I collect as a result of browsing and researching.
